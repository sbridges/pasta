Pasta
=====

The goal of pasta is to create a java library which allows for writing pst files.  Reading arbitrary pst files is not a goal, but the library should read enough to validate the pst files that it wrote.

Current Status
==============

Support for reading/validating the data structures of a pst file.  Pasta can read the BBT and NBT from the NDB layer.  Pasta can read BTH's, HN's, PC's and TC's from the LPT layer.

Some support for reading Folder/Message data structures built on top of these data structures.
